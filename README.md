# Mendel_old

This is my old version of an implementation of Mendel's principles. The code is under the GPLv2.0 license, but i cannot garuantee that any fonts or images used in this repo are.

The program works but its UI looks really bad and the code is absolutely horrible (i wrote it 1 or 2 years ago).
I am working on a new version written in rust and with gtk3 as the UI with a much smaller and more efficient code base. I will post the link to the new repo here when I'm done.
